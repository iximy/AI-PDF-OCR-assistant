# AI-PDF-OCR-assistant
Local AI assistant with downloading pdf or image documents

# About the project
Often, in order to find the necessary information in a document of several dozen pages, it is necessary to spend considerable time on familiarization, if there is a search for the text, then more complex tasks require the help of neural networks. There are a large number of AI services that can be used to feed our documents. Unfortunately, given the number of possible data leaks, uploading documents containing personal data or confidential information is a bad idea. If the use of such services for personal purposes is at your own risk, then the use for corporate purposes is often unacceptable. For example, in the medical, financial and legal sectors.

Since I specialize in finetune and the integration of local AI models in corporate tasks, the solution to this problem is based solely on the use of local AI technologies. The project is based on relatively recently released versions of AI models that have been reduced in number of parameters, although they have been reduced in number of parameters, which can be run even on home PCs equipped with video cards with a memory capacity of 6-8GB. For full-fledged models, this amount of VRAM on a home PC is certainly not enough in terms of the number of parameters, and the speed of home GPUs cannot be compared with commercial AI services, but it is quite enough to process medium-sized documents.

The purpose of this project is to implement an AI assistant working locally without Internet access, to which you can download a PDF document and send an AI request based on the data contained in it. Having received information in response, taking into account the information contained in the document

## Steps to launch the project

### 1. Clone the repository

Open a terminal and run the command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iximy/ai-pdf-ocr-assistant.git
cd ai-agent
```


---

### 2. Install the dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:
Software: Python, ollama, git 
Libraries: os, Json, ollama,Flask, logging, os, PyPDF2, easyocr

---

###3. Set up the configuration

Create a configuration file `config/config.json` and fill it in according to your settings:

```json
{
    "ollama": {
        "model_name": "ollama-model",
        "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
    },
    "server": {
        "host": "0.0.0.0",
        "port": 5000
    },
    "logging": {
        "level": "INFO",
        "file": "logs/app.log"
    },
    "documents_path": "documents/"
}
```

---

###4. Start the server

Start the server using the command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:5000 `.

---

### 5. Use the web interface

Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000 `. You will see a web interface that allows you to:

- Upload PDF or Image documents.
- Ask questions based on uploaded documents.

---

###6. Use the API

You can interact with the API via the command line or using tools such as Postman.

#### Example of a document upload request:
``bash
curl -X POST -F' "file=@document.pdf " http://localhost:5000/upload
```

#### Example of a question request:
``bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "What is the subject of the document?", "file_path": "documents/document.pdf"}' http://localhost:5000/ask
``

## Additional commands

- **Server shutdown:** Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running.
